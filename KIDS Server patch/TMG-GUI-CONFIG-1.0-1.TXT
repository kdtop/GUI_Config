Run Date: AUG 08,2008                   Designation: TMG-GUI-CONFIG*1.0*1
Package : TMG - FAMILY PHYSICANS OF GREENEVILLE  Priority: Optional
Version : 1       SEQ #1                       Status: Released
=============================================================================

Associated patches: None

Subject: Patch to support WorldVistA Configuration Utility

Category: 
  - Routine

Description: 
============

  This patch provides server support for a new Windows application that assists
  installers of new WorldVistA systems to configure aspects of the sytems.   

  SECURITY ISSUES:
  The configuration utility allows users easy access to all files on the system.
  Generally Fileman DB API calls are used for posting to the database.  One exception
  is made that allows users to set their Fileman access code to @.  Thus a user
  of this application can gain complete control of the sytem.  That was the intent,
  to allow administrators to effectively manage their systems.  But with easy use
  come easy potential for mistakes.

  Methods to limit access to the server:  During start up of the application, a 
  standard RPC login into the server is required.  The user must have the XUPROGMODE
  security key, OR have a unlocking menu OPTION added to their secondary menu field
  in their NEW PERSON file record.  The needed menu OPTION is:

      TMG RPC CONTEXT GUI_CONFIG  
  
  
  ROUTINE SUMMARY:
  ================
  Routine Summary
  The following routines are included in this patch.  The second line of each
  of these routines now looks like:
           ;;1.0;TMG-LIB;**[Patch List]**;07/20/08

                   Checksum
  Routine         Old       New      Patch List
  TMGRPC3           n/a  109709728   **1**

  Sites should use CHECK^XTSUMBLD to verify checksums.

  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
  This patch should cause minimal impact on live systems, as it provides only 1 routine,
  1 OPTION, and 1 REMOTE PROCEDURE.  Installation will take less than 1 minute.  Users
  may remain on the system.  Note: the follow instructions were copied from another KIDS
  install and modified.  There may be some discrepancies.

  The following are instructions for those using the Packman method:

      the Installation menu.
