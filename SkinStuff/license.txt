ADDITIONAL SITE LICENSE RIGHTS
Customers who have purchased a Site License may install and use multiple copies of the software for all users at a single site or within a single development team.

Using rhoStyle Components In Property Editors And Component Editors
Distributing a property editor or component editor that uses one or more of the components from this package requires that the compiled unit (i.e. he DCU file) for the Components also be distributed. (The compiled unit may be explicitly redistributed individually, or implicitly redistributed in the runtime packages that ship with this product.
IMPORTANT: The design-time package's files for each runtime package in this product MAY NOT be redistributed. In addition, redistributing the design packages included with this product is prohibited.
It is permissible to use the rhoStyle classes in custom design-time editors (such as property editors and component editors). However, because the DCU files will need to be distributed along with your design-time editor, it is possible for a user to install and use the component (implemented in the DCU file) even though the user may not be a licensed, registered user of Visual Component Library. Under these circumstances, your users WILL NOT be able to receive technical support on the component included in your editor, unless the user is also a licensed, registered user of rhoStyle Classes.
